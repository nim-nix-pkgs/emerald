# Emerald: HTML 5 Templating Engine for Nim

## Status

This was my very first Nim project, the goal was to test the versatility of Nim's macro system. It worked quite well.

Since I never went on to actually do something with it, this is now just code I myself do not really know anymore. I also don't have the time to maintain the project, so it is **unmaintained**. Use at your own risk.
